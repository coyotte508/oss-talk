## Fears, and why you shouldn't be afraid to OSS

- Paranoia that code is stolen
- support from community
- large numbers of programmers in the world, including users


### Exceptions

- Games - better not OS your game, especially if online multiplayer
- Proprietary algorithms

## It's possible to OSS and make money

### Working paying OSS software

- Lichess: through website
- Tidepool (full corporate): through the data
- Elasticsearch: through paid support / consulting
- SerenityOS: through sponsoring
- MongoDB: Through managed hosting (but the hosting solution is closed source)

### A valid model

- Get support from the community
- Get support from developers

## When to OSS?

Some examples:

- you make a tool which is not your end product (eg bootstrap, react, angular, npm modules) and do not want to maintain it all by yourself
- tools to interface with your products
- public recognition (hacktoberfest)
- Cool way to test a new tech & show off

## Risks when OSSing

### Need to maintain

- Example: underscore vs lodash
- It's hard to find maintainers (redis) and not fun
- No challenge - need to find motivation with community, use of new tech, ...

### Split in ideology

- Node split into io
- Bitcoin core / Bitcoin cash

### Changing licences

### Patents
